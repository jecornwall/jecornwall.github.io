Jason Cornwall is almost definitely a human being residing in Melbourne, Australia. 

By day he tries to tell computers what to do. By night he tries to tell his bass what to do. He also does other things but if you want a quick summary of how he sees himself you can use those two. 

He created this blog to pracice writing again after a while of not greasing that particular wheel.  

He likes the idea this section being written in the third-person, as it has the aire of a biographer summarising his life, which is truly the zenith of the narcisist.
