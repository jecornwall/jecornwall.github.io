Optimal distraction

Focus is using all of your brain on a task, no less no more. 

My Ego tells me that I could probably design a nuclear reactor if I needed to. Realistically this means "If I needed to, and had a dedicated six years and expert instruction equivalent to a bachelors and masters in the relevant engineering fields". The guilt machine in my head is now reminding me of the degree I dropped out of that would have been a great leg-up in this hypothetical scenario, but you can safely ignore that because you can't interface with my brain oh whoops I just typed that out.  

Filling in the gaps sometimes neccesary
