David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest is complicated. The perform a disgusting reduction on it, it's about entertainment, happiness, and the role of media and capitalism in those pursuits. 

One point that comes accross is that the pursuit of raw pleasure isn't always satisfying. But marketing as a practice wants us in this state of seeking gratification. If we're in a state where we're trying to find the thing that will deliver us the most pleasure for the least cost, we're more sususptable to consumerism. 

You end up in a state where you always assume there's something better, even if you're thouroughly entertained at that very moment. There could be something better, so you better go find it. 

This can apply to technology as much as it can apply to art.
