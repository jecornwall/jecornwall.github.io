Geniuses and professionals

Genius / Daemon

Peter Cook was a genius. By John Cleese's account, he is one of only three geniuses he's ever met. The severity of his genius was such that he was able to completely rely on its output for several decades, merely lending his mouth and pen to this sub-conscious daemon, with the resulting artifacts being directly transferable for professional respect, public adulation, and cold hard cash. His reliance was so complete that once the daemon had gone into retirement long before Peter Cook the man had planned to, Peter Cook the man had no ability to sit down with a blank piece of paper and through force of will and conscious effort manufacture the product he'd made a career of producing.
