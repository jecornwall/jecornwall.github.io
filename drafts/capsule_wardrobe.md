Fashion is cyclical. 

There's a curve. Crazy people make crazy clothes, it gets taken on by early adopters, it goes maintream, and then the early adopters find it passe as they had it on vinyl. 

There's an idea of a capsule wardrobe, where your cloths are limited to a set number of items, and you essentially wear the same thing each day. 

Many leaders of industry and of state subscribe to this sort of thing. They don't have the atttention to be making decisions about this sort of thing all the time. 

There's a tendency in start-up culture to spend a lot of time on these sorts of decisions. Maybe we don't need to.
