LinkedIn and Corporate Varnish

LinkedIn is a like a room full of professional salespeople, except nobody is acklowledging the salespeople-ship of everyone else. Everyone is trying to sell things to everyone else, but because people are there to sell rather than be sold to, not much gets sold. 

Most people have a layer of corporate varnish at the workplace. It's the layer between yourself and your colleuges that is designed to make you that little bit shinier, because being shiny means more money and respect. Different workplaces have different ranges of acceptable varnish for different levels of competence and charisma. You can always get away with less varnish the more competent or charismatic you are, but that doesn't mean you can ignore it completely. Even Alan Shore needs to wear a $3,000 suit while he wins impossible court cases and sexually harrasses his secretaries. 

At the bottom of the competency continuum, the prototype for survivability is pointy-haired boss from Dilbert. Pointy-haired boss is a charicature of middle-management that is completely absurd and soul-crushingly accurate.  Pointy-haired boss adds no value to the company, humanity and presumaby his family, and yet his continued employment is assured by a thick coating of coporate varnish. 

Types of varnish:
 - Amplifying your interests that imply competence, downplaying the contrary. 
 - Focusing your attention on people who are more likely to influence your pay.
 - Parroting the corporate culture and values, loudly on the street corner.
 - Making decisions based on which is least likely to expose your incompetency. What you think is best isn't as important as what you think is least likely to damage your reputation. 
 - Making decisions based on what will exalt you the most, rather than what will benefit the company the most. 
 - Dressing like other people dress. 
 - Caring about what other people care about, because they care about it.
