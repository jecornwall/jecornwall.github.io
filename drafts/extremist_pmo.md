Extremist views on communication

Agile started out with a lot of nice ideas. I wasn't around, but it seemed to be most people thought that dial had been turned the right way when agile came along after strugling with various incarnations of waterfall. 

Now we're here, in 2015, and Agile sucks. 

That's not my own view, but it seems to be the prevailing view of the developer populous. 

My own view is that we've got a classic case of overcorrection and zealtory. 

If we imagine a semi-circular dial, and characterise the left of that dial the free-wheeling, sprinting, high-fiving, containerised microservices, hyperbol-awesome tendencies of Agile; contrary wise characterising the right of the dial as the stugy old, 400 page specification, big-iron, COLBOL-won't-compile-unless-I'm-wearing-this-tie waterfall world. I believe we've gone two far to the left. The Agile Manifesto gave the dial a bit of kick perhaps towards center, but now the dial has been worn down by years of self-congratulation, certification and conferences.
