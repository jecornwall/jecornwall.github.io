Pattern matching is efficient. Modeling allows for insights. 

People working at the high levels in a field must rely on modeling. 

Pattern matching works best for the busy work. 

If we consider Theory of Constraints for an innovative organisation, the top level decision making needs be sourced from strong mental models. Otherwise you pattern match, do what you see others doing, and capitalism kills you. 

Strong mental models take work to build because they are often built up indirectly. There is no Olsen's Standard Book of British Birds for mental models. People with what the American's call a Liberal Arts education like to think they're well rounded. Strong mental models come from a certain well roundedness. 

If you're working in Ruby on Rails, your strongest insights are going to come from study outside of Ruby on Rails. You can become very efficient at the platform by practicing with the platform, but when you start reaching the platform's limitations you'll be reaching your own limitations.
